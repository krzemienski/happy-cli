# Wave 2 - Agent B: Connection Verification

## Mission
Verify mobile app successfully connects to daemon after authentication

## Monitoring Setup

### Current Status
- **Daemon Log**: `/Users/nick/.happy-dev/logs/2025-09-30-10-01-50-pid-17408.log`
- **Monitoring Started**: 2025-09-30 10:05:00
- **Waiting for**: Agent A to initiate authentication

### Monitoring Scripts Created
1. **Real-time Monitor**: `scripts/monitor_daemon_connection.sh`
   - Continuously monitors new log entries
   - Filters for auth/connection/session events
   - 60-second duration

2. **Periodic Sampler**: `scripts/sample_daemon_logs.sh`
   - Samples last 50 log lines
   - 10 samples at 3-second intervals
   - Captures auth/connection/error events

## Pre-Authentication Baseline

### Initial Log State
```
[10:01:50.334] Spawning Claude Code process (SDK test)
[10:02:02.292] Spawning Claude Code process (SDK test)
```

No authentication or connection events present in baseline.

## Authentication Timeline

**Status**: Monitoring active - No authentication events detected yet

### Monitoring Results (as of 00:02:30)
- Ran 10 periodic samples at 3-second intervals
- Checked last 50 log lines each sample
- **Result**: No authentication or connection events detected
- **Conclusion**: Agent A has not yet initiated authentication

### Daemon Log Activity
- Last activity: SDK test messages at 10:02:02
- No new entries since initial startup
- Daemon process confirmed running (PID 17408)

### Expected Event Sequence
1. Mobile authentication request received
2. Decrypting authentication payload
3. Authentication successful for user
4. Mobile client connected with session ID
5. WebSocket session established
6. Encryption key exchange completed

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Auth request appears in logs
- [ ] Payload decryption successful
- [ ] Authentication successful message
- [ ] Mobile client connected
- [ ] WebSocket session established
- [ ] No authentication errors
- [ ] No connection errors
- [ ] Session ID present in logs

## Log Evidence

### Pre-Authentication
*Baseline captured - waiting for auth events*

### Authentication Events
*Will be captured when Agent A initiates authentication*

### Connection Events
*Will be captured after successful auth*

### Error Events
*None expected - will document if any occur*

## Next Steps

1. Monitor logs during Agent A's authentication
2. Capture all relevant log entries
3. Verify connection timeline
4. Document any issues or errors
5. Confirm successful mobile connection

## Summary

### Monitoring Infrastructure Ready
✅ Created real-time monitoring script (`monitor_daemon_connection.sh`)
✅ Created periodic sampling script (`sample_daemon_logs.sh`)
✅ Identified active daemon log file
✅ Established baseline (no auth events)
✅ Ran initial monitoring cycle (10 samples)

### Current State
- **Daemon**: Running (PID 17408)
- **Log File**: `/Users/nick/.happy-dev/logs/2025-09-30-10-01-50-pid-17408.log`
- **Authentication Status**: Not started
- **Agent A**: Has not initiated authentication yet

### Next Actions Required
1. **Wait for Agent A** to begin authentication process
2. **Run monitoring** when auth activity detected
3. **Capture timeline** of auth → connection events
4. **Verify success** against checklist criteria
5. **Document findings** in this report

### Notes for Wave Coordination
- Agent B infrastructure is ready and waiting
- No authentication activity detected in initial monitoring
- Scripts are prepared to capture all relevant events when they occur
- Will update this document when authentication begins
